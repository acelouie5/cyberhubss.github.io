              <p>Spyware is a type of malicious software (malware) that is designed to monitor and gather information from a computer system without the user's knowledge or consent.

                Once installed on a computer, spyware can track the user's online activity, log keystrokes, record passwords, and capture sensitive information such as credit card numbers and personal identification details. The data gathered by spyware is often sent to a third-party without the user's knowledge or consent, where it can be used for malicious purposes such as identity theft and fraud.</p>

             <ul><strong>Never Click on Unverified Links</strong>
              <li> •	If a link is in a spam email or on a strange website, you should avoid it. Often, hackers spread ransomware through a malicious link that initiates a malware download. If a link has not been verified, it is best to leave it alone.</li>
             </ul>
             <ul><strong>Scan Email for Malwares</strong>
              <li> •	How to stop ransomware virus or other malware starts with scanning email communications. Email scanning tools can often detect malicious software. After the scanner has detected malware, the email can be discarded, never even reaching your inbox.</li>
             </ul>
             <ul><strong>Use Firewalls and Endpoint Protection</strong>
              <li>•	Firewalls can be a good solution as you figure out how to stop ransomware attacks. Firewalls scan the traffic coming from both sides, examining it for malware and other threats. With endpoint protection, individual endpoints are shielded from threats. There are certain types of traffic that are more prone to carrying threats, and endpoint protection can keep your device from engaging with those kinds of data.	</li>

            <ul><strong>Only Download from Trusted Sites</strong>
              <li>•	If you are not familiar with the site or if its Uniform Resource Locator (URL) looks suspicious even though it appears to be a trusted site, you should steer clear. Always double-check the URL of a site before downloading anything from it.	</li>
             </ul>
             <ul><strong>Keep Backups of Important Data</strong>
              <li> •	If your data is backed up to a device or location you do not need your computer to access, you can simply restore the data you need if an attack is successful. It is important to make sure you back up all critical data frequently because if enough time goes by, the data you have may be insufficient to support your business’s continuity.</li>
             </ul>
             <ul><strong>Do Not Use Unfamiliar USB Device</strong>
              <li> •	A Universal Serial Bus (USB) device can be used to store a malicious file that could contain ransomware. If you ever find a USB device, do not insert it into your computer. The safest USBs are those purchased from a store and sealed inside intact packaging.	</li>
