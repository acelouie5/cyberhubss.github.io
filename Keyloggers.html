                A keylogger is a type of malicious software (malware) that is designed to record every keystroke typed on a computer keyboard.
                
                Once installed, a keylogger can capture sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal data. This information can be transmitted to a remote attacker, who can use it for fraudulent purposes, such as stealing money from bank accounts or stealing sensitive business information.</p>

             <ul><strong>Use a Firewall</strong>
              <li>•	The Windows Firewall is an excellent option for most users, but several excellent third-party firewall options come with extensive functionality. A firewall alone might not stop a keylogger or its associated malware, but it is better to have one than not.</li>
             </ul>
             <ul><strong>Install a Password Manager</strong>
              <li> •	The point of a password manager wasn't to stop keylogging. However, if you do encounter a keylogger and you have a password manager installed, there's a chance you only lose the strong single-use password for one account, rather than every password for every account you own.	</li>
             </ul>
             <ul><strong>Update your System</strong>
              <li> •	Being proactive about system security is always a good idea. One of the most important parts of a proactive defense is keeping your system up to date. That includes your operating system as well as the applications and programs you run on it.	</li>
             </ul>

            <ul><strong>Change Your Password</strong>
              <li> •	Frequently changing your passwords will help minimize the potential damage of a keylogging attack. Your password may be stolen, but it would be uncommon for it to be stolen and used immediately unless that keylogger was targeted directly at you (in which case you may have bigger problems than keylogging!). If you change your password every two weeks, your stolen information will no longer be useful.</li>
             </ul>
             <ul><strong>	Ghostpress</strong>
              <li> • a free anti-keylogger with an extremely small performance footprint. Features Process Protection to stop any other program terminating Ghostpress. 	</li>
             </ul>
             <ul><strong>KL-Detector</strong>
              <li>• a basic keylogger detection tool. Once you detect a keylogger, it's up to you to remove it, but the tool will alert you to the keyloggers presence.</li>
