                Spyware is a type of malicious software (malware) that is designed to monitor and gather information from a computer system without the user's knowledge or consent.

                Once installed on a computer, spyware can track the user's online activity, log keystrokes, record passwords, and capture sensitive information such as credit card numbers and personal identification details. The data gathered by spyware is often sent to a third-party without the user's knowledge or consent, where it can be used for malicious purposes such as identity theft and fraud.

             <ul><strong>Deter Downloads</strong>
              <li> •	Walk this line carefully: Don't let friends and family - especially the tech neophytes like your grandmother - download anything. Then download and install the Google Toolbar for them.</li>
             </ul>
             <ul><strong>Teach Back-up and Restore Basics</strong>
              <li>  •	Teach users how to create restore points in XP and to set one before every download from a Web site that's not a brand-name portal. Disk space shouldn't be a problem on newer PCs, but even if they fill up their hard disks, eliminating some restore points is much easier than cleaning a spyware infection.	</li>
             </ul>
             <ul><strong>Create a Spyware Removal CD</strong>
              <li> 	•	Make your own spyware tool kit by burning a half-dozen spyware utilities to CD.	</li>
             </ul>

            <ul><strong>Run at least two Spyware Cleaners</strong>
              <li> •	Run several utilities, run them regularly, vary them and make sure they're all up to date. Paid cleaners provide more constant signature file updates, but even freeware adds new capabilities regularly. Run, update, run, update, repeat. I clean a system, reboot into Safe Mode and clean it with a second tool, then reboot again.</li>
             </ul>
             <ul><strong>Close desktop communication holes</strong>
              <li> •	Look for products that do stateful packet inspection of incoming and outgoing packets. A combination of personal firewall and router controls isn't overkill, especially for users who can't resist the lure of spyware-laden sites.	</li>
             </ul>
             <ul><strong>Deal with Digital Rights Management (DRM)</strong>
              <li> •	One answer is to avoid DRM applications such as music players, especially those from Microsoft. If you prefer your music, get a resident commercial spyware utility that updates its spyware database regularly because it will coordinate protection with the music services.	</li>
